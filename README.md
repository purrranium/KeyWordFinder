How to use the files
!You need to install Python to be able to use the tools! 

1. Save input, keywords, and main files into a separate folder with no other files 
2. Open the input file and insert text you need to analyze. Save.
3. Click on the folder address (where the «key» folder name is)
4. Type «cmd», press enter - the command window will open
5. Copy the python string from the «python string.txt» file
6. Paste it into the command line, press enter
7. The «results» file will be created

Possible bugs
If not working (you can see different error names), try the following:
- If you edited the key words list, check if you have commas after every key word
- Try to open your input file in Word and save as a «plain text»
